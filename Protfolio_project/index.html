                        <h2>Hello..Ashraful Islam</h2>
                        <p>Web development is a fast growing form of artistic expression that uses computer programming and technical writing skills to create Web sites. Web developers earn an appealing salary that increases as specialized skills are introduced. Formal education and training play a vital role in the preparation and experience of a developer. A survey indicates that most companies today have a Web site and need the skills of developers. Legal issues for developers and employers are introduced. </p>
                        <p>My occupation of choice is web developer, and I chose this because even though I don't know everything about computers I am very fast at learning about them.</p>
                        <p>As a web developer, I will create and keep up with websites, including the layout, and function according to the client. (Web Developer) Web designing has really developed over time ever since the “World Wide Web” was created and it has visually improved as well as the speed and mobility. The requirements for this occupation vary with what kind of work that they do, they can range from a high school diploma to a bachelor’s degree.</p>
                        <p>My interest in Web development came from experience learning to design and build my own personal Web site. It is an outlet that allowed me to combine computer skills and creativity. I enjoyed the creative a Web developer.</p>
